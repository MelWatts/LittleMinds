## Strategy

### User Needs

As a user the site has to be accessible on mobile, tablet and all browsers. Information should be clear to read, informative and helpful.
The site navigation needs to be optimal to move to the preferred section of the user.

### Business vision

The purpose of this project is to give users peace of mind and help is out there. 
The site also gives the users easy access to external sites to talk to professionals, find other people to talk to in the same position, and watch meditation and mindful videos .

## Scope

I want my users to feel they are not alone, there are like minded parents / carers, professionals to talk to and generally help is out there for the ones they love. 

## Structure

This project is a 3 page website. With the home page being things that can help keep a young people mentally well. An information page where users can find links to various other website where they will find help, chat forums and professional consultations. The third page is a contact form this is so users can reach out to the team and they will guide them to the correct help and resources.

## Wireframes

The Tablet wireframe can be found [Here] (assets/images/tablet-wireframe.JPG)

The Mobile wireframe can be found [Here] (assets/images/mobile-wireframe.JPG)

### Changes to wireframes

My site has changed considerably from the intitial wireframe, as I had my initial idea and as I started to build my page it took me in another direction, the more I descovered new methods.


## Features

This section contains some of the features this project contains:
* The homepage will be the landing page showing a large hero image to draw people in, and a short paragraph showcasing how the website is of use to the user and an additional more info button.
* Scrolling down to the paragraph about mental health and a couple of nice images, I've added a contact us button here in case the user want to make contact.
* I have added a static image of some sun shining through trees, my thoughts were calming and hopeful in worrying times.
* I have added 3 images of young 'happy' children and some bullet point of tips to keep children happy.
* Further down is more information on the signs of mental health issues to look for and how to support.
* Then a couple of meditation videos and wellbeing tips to watch so assist the user and their child.
* Some helpful links to other sites including an online chat room for like minded people, to book therapy sessions and general help.
* Ending the website with a simple contact form and links to our social media platforms to keep in contact or follow us.

### Testing

## Testing Plan

I started this project, based on a desktop, once I was happy with the look I worked on my media query starting with mobile and working up through the various break off points of various screen sizes. This proved to be a mistake, as I was writing so much css for each screen size, my css document started to get overwhelming. After talks with my mentor we decided to go down the columns route as it proved much easier and better for all screen sizes. 

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

## First Time Visitor Goals

# As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

* Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "More Information" Call to action button.
* The main points are made immediately with the navigation bar and call to action buttons
* The user has three options, click the call to action buttons, scroll through the information, tips and help or click on the navigation bar to go directly to the place they need. b
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

* The site has been designed to be fluid and informative, easy to navigate. Each link describes what section teh visitor will end up on.
* Throughout the site there are call to actions, at the bottom there is a simple easy to fill out contact form.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want them to locate our social media links to see our following on social media to determine how trusted and known we are.

* Once the new visitor has read the gone through teh site, they will notice helpful links to on-line forums and professional therapists.
* The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate teh contact us form and social media links in the footer.
* At the bottom of the sit on the Contact Us section, the user can see, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

## Returning Visitor Goals

# As a Returning Visitor, I want the visitor to find the where they were previously and feel reasured we are here to help.


As a Returning Visitor, I want them to find the best way to get in contact with us with any questions they may have.

* The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.

* Here they can fill out the form on the page or alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
* The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page.
* Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
* As a Returning Visitor, I want them to find the Facebook Group link so that they can join and interact with others in the community.

* The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

## Frequent User Goals

# As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added help or advice.

* The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the call to action buttons or teh navigation bar.
* As a Frequent User, I want them to check to see if there are any new infomation, tips or help.
* The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the links to external sites.
* As a Frequent User, I want them to follow us on social media.
* There is a "Submit" button to the bottom of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

### Further Testing

* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all sections were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Implementation

As this is the first website that I created on my own I had no experience debugging on my own. Testing was mainly done using DevTools in google chrome. 
Starting mobile first then working my way up to bigger screen sizes. 
Whenever an element wasn't located where I wanted it to be I would use the `element.style` box in DevTools to find a solution. 

I used the WC3 code validators to check my code for mistakes as well. 

Testing is done in the following way: 

1. Scroll up and down the page checking for overflow and general positioning of items.
2. Use navigation bar to move to section of the page. 
3. In the form, try and click the button to check whether all fields are required to be filled in, check as well whether the e-mail part was set to e-mail.
4. Check all links in the footer whether they react as intended by opening in a new tab (for links section in footer). 
5. Run through all of these steps for each different screen size.
6. Use HTML and CSS validators from W3C schools to find mistakes in code.


### Results

Once I had a general idea on how to run testing I followed all steps for each of my pages which gave me the following results:

* 2 class to one div, this was rectified
* Tried having control="" on my iframe.
* Tried having muted on my iframe. 
* Tried having loop on my iframe.
* I have 3 warnings left to rectify, all are 'Section lacks heading'.


* HTML-validator results: [index.html](assets/images/html-results/index-results.png)

* CSS-validator results: [style.css](assets/images/css-validator.JPG)



### Bugs

#### Media query

After writing my media query for a mobile, I noticed that, that was overwriting my desktop version. After a lot of meetings with my mentor and lots of chat and help from my fellow students on Slack, it was decided that all of my website was not set in columns or grids, once this was done everything was much clearer.

#### Images

Early on I was having a hard time getting the images to display properly. They looked good on a desktop version but wasn't scaling properly for tablet or mobile. This was due to using px height and width instead of %.



## Deployment

This project is deployed using gitpod in combination with github pages.
I used gitpod to write all code and seeing it is linked with github it was easy to use the terminal to commit, unfortunately in my haste I have committed a few spelling errors of which I did a quick google search to see if I could rectify this, I couldn't see a way.

### GitHub Pages

## The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
   * Alternatively Click Here for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

              <h2>Children and young people</h2>
          <p> Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children and young people. They include depression, anxiety and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives.
              Alarmingly, however, 70% of children and young people who experience a mental health problem have not had appropriate interventions at a sufficiently early age.
              The emotional wellbeing of children is just as important as their physical health. Good mental health allows children and young people to develop the resilience to cope with whatever life throws at them and grow into well-rounded, healthy adults.

            <h2>Children and young people</h2>
                    <p> Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children and young people. They include depression, anxiety and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives.
                        Alarmingly, however, 70% of children and young people who experience a mental health problem have not had appropriate interventions at a sufficiently early age.
                        The emotional wellbeing of children is just as important as their physical health. Good mental health allows children and young people to develop the resilience to cope with whatever life throws at them and grow into well-rounded, healthy adults.

                <h2>How do I know if someone has a mental health problem?</h2>
                <p>Sometimes it will seem obvious when someone is going through a hard time, but there is no simple way of knowing if they have a mental health problem. Sometimes you don’t need to know. It’s more important to respond sensitively to someone who seems troubled than to find out whether or not they have a diagnosis.
                    Although certain symptoms are common with specific mental health problems, no two people behave in exactly the same way when they are unwell. If you know the person well, you may notice changes in their behaviour or mood.</p>

                         The Five Ways to Wellbeing - researched and developed by the New Economics Foundation for the Department of Health and Social Care - are five simple things we can implement in our daily lives to improve our mental and physical wellbeing.
                         In a series of videos to mark Mental Health Awareness Week, Sanctuary Group introduces each of the five ways and discusses how, right now, they are more important than ever before.
